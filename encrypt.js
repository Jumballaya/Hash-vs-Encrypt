/**
 * Encrypt
 *
 * Encryption is a two-way process where some data, like a string, can be converted
 * into different looking data, like another string or numbers. This different looking
 * data is called the encrypted data and the original data is the plaintext data. The encrypted
 * data can be ran backwards through the encryption process to produce the plaintext data.
 *
 * This looks like this:
 *
 *  Encrypt:
 *    `plaintext data` -> `encryption_algrorithm` -> `encrypted data`
 *
 *  Decrypt:
 *    `encrypted data` -> `decryption_algrorithm` -> `plaintext data`
 *
 * One of the most basic encryption techniques is called the [caesar cypher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)
 * and it encrypts the plaintext string by first turning each letter into a corresponding number,
 * a=0 b=1 etc., the next step involves adding a number to each of the converted letters and
 * wrapping around back to 'a' after we pass 'z'
 *
 * The most popular use of a caesar cypher is a system called ROT13, or rotated by 13, where we use
 * 13 as our number to add to each letter.
 * Using our example of encryption above we can see what ROT13 looks like with the word 'cat':
 *
 *  CAT -> [C=2, A=0, T=19] +13 = [15=P, 13=N, (32-26=6)=G] -> PNG
 *
 *  As you can see we put in 'CAT' as plaintext and get 'PNG' out as our encrypted data.
 *  The two-way part comes into play when we want to send our encrypted message to a friend.
 *  If they want to understand your message they will have to decrypt it using the same technique
 *  but in reverse. Remember to wrap back to 'z' if we go under 'a'.
 *
 *  PNG -> [P=15, N=13, G=6] -13 = [2=C, 0=A, (-7+26=19)=T] -> CAT
